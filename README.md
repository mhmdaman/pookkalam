Digital Pookkalam

A creative project built for a competition, where tradition meets technology! Instead of arranging real flowers, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas/React) to design a beautiful digital Pookkalam — the traditional floral carpet made during Onam.

About the Project

This project is my way of celebrating Onam in a modern style. The goal was to blend culture with coding and show how art and technology can come together. The Pookkalam pattern is generated with colorful shapes and petals, creating a festive and vibrant look.
